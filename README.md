Development of a web server for connecting drug, herbal medicine, genes, gene pathways, miRNAs and diseases. This project is to pursue a systematic approach to discover associations among drug, herbal medicine, genes, gene pathways, miRNAs and diseases. Genes and gene pathways will be used as a common ‘language’ to connect diseases and drugs, diseases and herbal medicine, or miRNAs and diseases.  This project will be important for drug discovery and development such as in identifying and suggesting new diseases for existing drugs and elucidating mode of actions for novel chemicals in addition to potentially predicting drug interactions. All connections (from the public databases) shown in the following figure will be assembled into a SQL Server database. A good part of this system has been built, you are to add more tables and more stored procedures to make it complete.
